Automated Web Hosting Solution with single click replication to UAT And Prod Environment : 
To build an automated web hosting solution using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates,
we'll create a setup that includes virtual machine-based web servers, an Azure Load Balancer,
and a method for deploying this setup to Development, UAT (test), and Production environments using environment-specific parameters.
Objective:
Create an automated web hosting solution with single-click deployment to multiple environments (Development, UAT, Production) using ARM templates.
The solution includes:
•	Virtual machines for hosting web servers.
•	An Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
•	Environment-specific parameterization for easy replication and configuration management.
